Disease-Outbreak-Prediction
📌 Overview

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict potential disease outbreaks by analyzing historical health, demographic, and environmental data. The model leverages data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive algorithms to provide early warning signals for outbreak risks.

The system can help public health organizations and government agencies take preventive measures, allocate resources efficiently, and improve community preparedness.

⚡ Features

Predicts disease outbreak likelihood based on historical and real-world data.

Data preprocessing pipeline for handling missing values, scaling, and cleaning.

Feature engineering from environmental, demographic, and healthcare indicators.

Machine learning models (Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) for prediction.

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

Visualization of outbreak risk trends and predictive insights.

🛠️ Tech Stack / Tools Used

Language: Python

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, XGBoost, RandomForestClassifier

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Preprocessing: Scikit-learn pipelines, feature scaling, missing value handling

🚀 Model Workflow

Data Collection & Cleaning – Removing missing values, handling imbalance.

Feature Engineering – Creating outbreak risk features from environment + population.

Model Training – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost tested.

Evaluation – Metrics like accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score.

Prediction – Outputs outbreak probability with confidence scores.

📈 Results

Achieved strong prediction accuracy (exact numbers depend on dataset).

Identified key influencing features such as population density, temperature, and rainfall.

Outbreak risk visualization clearly highlighted potential hotspots.
